Below is a simple data flow diagram (DFD) for a login and registration page in a web application:

               +------------------+
               |    External      |
               |     Users        |
               +---------+--------+
                         |
                         v
          +--------------+-------------+
          |   Login and Registration   |
          |           Page             |
          +--------------+-------------+
                         |
         +---------------|--------------+
         |               |              |
         v               v              v
+----------------+  +-------------+  +------------------+
|  User Database |  | Registration|  |    Authentication|
|    (Data Store)|  |   Process   |  |     Process      |
+----------------+  +-------------+  +------------------+

In this DFD:

External Users: These are the users accessing the login and registration page from outside the system.

Login and Registration Page: This is the interface presented to the users where they can either log in or register for a new account.

User Database (Data Store): This is where user information, such as usernames and passwords, is stored. It's represented as a data store.

Registration Process: This process handles the user registration. It receives user-provided information and stores it in the user database.

Authentication Process: This process handles user authentication during the login process. It verifies the user's credentials against the information stored in the user database.

Data flows:

From external users to the login and registration page.
From the login and registration page to the registration process during registration.
From the registration process to the user database to store new user information.
From the login and registration page to the authentication process during login.
From the user database to the authentication process to verify user credentials.
This diagram illustrates the flow of data and processes involved in user login and registration within the system.
