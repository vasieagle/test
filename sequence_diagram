Explanation:

The User interacts with the system by clicking on the Register button.
The system (Login/Register component) displays the registration form.
The User enters their registration data.
The system validates the entered registration data.
If the data is valid, the system saves the user data into the database, indicating successful registration.
The User interacts with the system by clicking on the Login button.
The system displays the login form.
The User enters their login credentials.
The system validates the entered login credentials.
If the credentials are valid, the system retrieves user data from the database, indicating successful login.
This sequence diagram illustrates the step-by-step interactions between the User, the Login/Register component, and the Database during the registration and login processes.
